    "# N-Gram detection with 1D Convolution\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous examples, we have run tasks on embeddings in each word, but we sometimes should handle a set of ordered items.<br>\n",
    "For instance, \"hot dog\" won't be in the species of \"dog\", but it will be a part of food. \"Paris Hilton\" will also be far from \"Paris\" in language context. Even when you find \"good\" in the sentence, it might be a signal of negative sentiment in the context \"not good\".<br>\n",
    "Not only bi-grams, but the same is true for tri-grams and generic N-grams.\n",
    "\n",
    "The convolution network (CNN) is a today's widely used model in computer vision (such as, image classification, object detection, segmentation, etc). In NLP, this convolutional architecture can also be applied in N-gram detection.<br>\n",
    "In computer vision, 2D convolution (convolution by 2 dimensions of width and height) is generally used, but in N-gram detection, 1D convolution is applied as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Bi-gram CNN](images/bigram_convolution.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "There exist several variations for N-gram detection in NLP by convolutions.<br>\n",
    "The **hierarchical convolutions** can capture patterns with gaps, such as, \"not --- good\" or \"see --- little\" where \"---\" stands for a short sequence of words.<br>\n",
    "Similar to image processing, **multiple channels** can also be applied in NLP convolution. For instance, when each word has multiple embeddings (such as, word embedding, POS-tag embedding, position-wise word embedding, etc), these embeddings can be manipulated as multiple channels in NLP.<br>\n",
    "Or, after applying multiple N-grams (such as, 2-gram, 4-gram, and 6-gram), the results can also be manipulated as multiple channels.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, I'll simply apply bi-gram detection using 1D convolution (with a single channel) for the purpose of your beginning.\n",

(i.e, In convolutions, the size of window is 2 (bi-gram) and the size of stride is 1.)<br>\n",
    "In this example, we apply half padding convolution (i.e, apply $ \\mathbf{x}_i = [\\mathbf{w}_i, \\mathbf{w}_{i+1}] $ for $ i=1,\\ldots,m $ where $\\mathbf{w}_{m+1}$ is zero) and the number of outputs will then also be $m$.<br>\n",
